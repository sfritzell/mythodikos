# Mythodikos
Digitally Mapping Mythical People and Places

## Project Objective
- Drawing upon a substantial dataset representing ancient literary (and eventually material resources), develop and publish an interactive map to aid scholars in addressing questions of “Where does a particular figure of myth appear”, and subsequently, “Who from myth is associated with this particular place”.

## Project Deliverable
- Interactive LeafletJS map with citations to primary source texts.
- Supporting website to provide additional details on team members, project aims, methodology, data, and references.

## Project Description
Maps allow us to visualize more than just landmarks.  They also enable us to consider the migration of people, the history of trade routes, and the exchange of culture.  The Mythodikos project, Ancient Greek for “connected to myth”, will create a dataset and searchable map-interface which will allow a student or scholar to consider mythological figures not just as they are associated with particular texts, authors, and traditions of writing, but also as they are connected to various geographical spaces.  Unlike traditional forms of scholarship concerned with literature and mythology, which are readily capable of dealing with questions of Who, What, and even How, this mapping project will open up consideration of the question of Where a particular mythological figure appears in literary accounts.  Mythodikos will allow us to consider the movement of a particular figure throughout space, speculate on the geographical scope in which their story was transmitted, and imagine the connections between certain localities on account of their shared association with a mythological figure.

Projects that have begun to combine the visual advantages and utility of digital mapping with exploration of textual and material resources, but have not examined the specific link between person and place in the way that Mythodikos is intended to address.  These include: 
- [MANTO](https://www.manto-myth.org/), a collaboration between the Australian National University and the University of New Hampshire
- [Topos Text](https://topostext.org/index.php), supported by the Aikaterini Laskaridis Foundation
- [Pleiades](https://pleiades.stoa.org/)
- [Pelagios Commons](http://commons.pelagios.org/)
- [Recogito](https://recogito.pelagios.org/), a Pelagios tool
- [Peripleo](https://peripleo.pelagios.org/), a Pelagios tool

During the 2019-21 academic years work was done to develop a text-mining tool using Python and Natural Language Processing methods that can be used to search the Perseus Digital Library Greek corpus for person-place connections and to record these search results as a preliminary dataset. 

Work during the 2021-22 academic year will continue to refine the current text-mining tool for more accurate use with the Greek literary corpus, expand upon the initial dataset, integrate ancient geographical data provided by Pleiades with the project dataset, and develop a preliminary LeafletJS map that will draw upon this information. Steps will also be taken to develop a workflow for eventually integrating the Latin literary corpus, as well as material resources.
